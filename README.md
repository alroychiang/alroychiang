I am a fresh graduate with a strong interest in data engineering looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting! I have worked with companies such as EDP Renewables and Smart Nation Translational Laboratories to aid in audio processing and data cleaning projects which will be described in more detail below.

- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better programmer!
- 👨‍💻 I have a brief experience with SQL, Java, and C.
- 🚧 I have a fair bit of experience in Python for data cleaning and data validation!
- 🦕 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn and put my skills to use.
