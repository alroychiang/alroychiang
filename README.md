I am a fresh graduate with a strong interest in coding looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting! I have worked with companies such as EDP Renewables and Smart Nation Translational Laboratories to aid in audio processing and data cleaning projects which will be described in more detail below.

- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a better programmer!
- 👨‍💻 I have a brief experience with SQL, Java, and C.
- 🚧 I have a strong foundation in Python for data cleaning and data validation!
- 🦕 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can learn and put my skills to use.

### Tools:
*  **Database Management:** SQL, MySQL
*  **Audio Pre-Processing:** Python, Jupyter Labs, soundfile, noisereduce, cv2, converter, pydub, youtube_dl, numpy, pandas, shutil, subprocess, openpyxyl, moviepy, tqdm, converter, ffmpeg
*  **Data Visualization:** VS Code, Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib
*  **Data Cleaning:** VS Code, Python, numpy, pandas, json, os, glob, csv, shutil, re, sys, datetime

### Projects:

* ### [Audio Processing](https://github.com/roitoimalfoi/SNTL-Intern.git)
 - Conducted video processing using Python, JupyterLabs & Audacity to automate the conversion of audio
file formats, download significant audio and video datasets from an online repository.
 - Performed data cleaning by normalizing audio waveforms and reducing background noises on audio
datasets for future Machine Learning projects.
 - Developed an automated process using ffmpeg to accurately crop over 400 video files given their unique
timestamps corresponding from an external Excel file.

* ### [Data Pre-Processing](https://github.com/roitoimalfoi/data-pre-processing-pipline.git)
 - Utilized Python’s json, pandas, numpy, re, csv, shutil, os, datetime and glob libraries to develop a data
pre-processing pipeline handling data quality, data transformation, meta data generation and data
publication.
 - Employed the pipeline to identify missing values & outliers, transform logarithmic & time series data,
perform data aggregation, execute time gap analysis and construct a data catalogue.
 - Maintained and produced user, design and test procedure documentations to establish and maintain the
pipeline development process.

* ### [Data Validation](https://github.com/alroychiang/data-validation)
 - Applied matplotlib library to conduct Data Validation on historical energy data, successfully identifying
data dropouts and permanent step changes in our data collection system.
 - Deployed matplotlib library to conduct Correlation Analysis on time series data.

### Database Management Course:

* ### [Managing Big Data with MySQL](https://github.com/roitoimalfoi/Managing-Big-Data-with-MySQL.git)
 - Designed Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams from data relationship sentences, gained a better understanding of attributes, unique attributes, entity instances and partial keys.
 - Designed Relational Schemas from their respective ER diagrams and data relationship sentences as well. Gained a better understanding of tables, primary keys, foreign keys and many-to-many relationships
 - Utilized SQL to extract, sort, identify data of interest from a real world dataset (Dognition database). Generate queries and sub queries using clauses such as GROUP BY, FULL JOIN, DISTINCT, HAVING etc.
